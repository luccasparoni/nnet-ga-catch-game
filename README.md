### Libraries
 I used `Pygame` to render the game and `numpy` to create the neural net base.

### Row to run

Simply run the main.py file

 `python3 main.py`
 
 
 ### Edit parameters
 
 In the `defs.py` file are all the definitions used in the game, especially the genetic ones. Just change some parameter and re-reun the game to use it.
